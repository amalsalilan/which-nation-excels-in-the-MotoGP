# which-nation-excels-in-the-MotoGP
We will attempt to provide a response to the aforementioned query in this notebook, namely if Italy is the best country in terms of MotoGP performance.

What does the term "best" mean? The number of function Object() { [native code] } championships and real rider championships that a country has won will be used to calculate its performance. We will base our final judgments on the findings we have made.
